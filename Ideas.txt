Project Ideas:
1. Simple way to show reversing or something using a pi and rbg lights maybe?

2. Raspberry Pi Train
3. RF Locks

4. Magnetic lock where challenges are finished which causes the pi to send a signal to unlock the box
        - geared towards web app hosted challenges (3 - 5)
            - permutations: brute force keypad?
            - Guided RE
            - Networks
            - Passwords
        - maybe access a shell to run unlock.py ? or a ./ executable
